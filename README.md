# MLBlindCodes

A collection of keyed-alike Master Lock blind codes from Accredited Lock Supply's catalog. "All 1, 3, 5 KA Non Deduplicated" is a concatenation of all the blind codes for individual lock models included in this repo. "1, 3, 5 Code Occurences" is the last file, run through (uniq -c | sort -r) to count the number of occurences of each blind code. See $blogspotlink for more details.
